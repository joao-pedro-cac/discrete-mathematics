# Discrete Mathematics

This repository keeps all the codes of Discrete Mathematics classes taken as a student of _Universidade Federal de Uberlândia_ (Federal University of Uberlândia).

OBS: They were mainly written in Portuguese

- `rel.py`: Takes an _A_ set, creates **_A x A_** and **_P(A x A)_**, classifies each subset of _A x A_ as **reflexive**, **simetric**, **transitive** and **equivalent** and outputs everything onto a text file.
- `rel-bin.py`: Similar to `rel.py`, but applies a **mathematical abstraction**. Each subset of _A x A_ is represented by a number according to the elements it contains. The operations then proceed based on this abstraction.
- `base.py`: Collection of number base conversion functions. Available number bases: **BIN** (base-2), **OCT** (base-8), **DEC** (base-10) and **HEX** (base-16).
