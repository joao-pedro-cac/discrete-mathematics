# Discrete Mathematics

This repository keeps all the codes of Discrete Mathematics classes taken as a student of the _Universidade Federal de Uberlândia_ (Federal University of Uberlândia).

OBS: They were mainly written in Portuguese

- `pc.c`: Takes two sets, _A_ and _B_, and prints the cartesian products **_A x B_** and **_B x A_**.
- `rel.py`: Takes an _A_ set, creates **_A x A_** and **_P(A x A)_**, classifies each subset of _A x A_ as **reflexive**, **simetric**, **transitive** and **equivalent** and outputs everything onto a text file.
